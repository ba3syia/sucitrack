## 1. Introduction

SuciTrack is a specialized, Laravel-based web application cater assist Muslim women in tracking their menstrual cycles (Hayd) and periods of purity (Tuhr) in strict accordance with Shariah (Islamic jurisprudence) guidelines.

Navigating the complexities of Islamic rulings regarding prayer (Salah) during and after menstruation can be challenging. SuciTrack addresses this by replacing manual calculations with an automated, reliable digital solution. By combining the robust Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture of Laravel with precise jurisprudential logic, the platform empowers users to maintain the five daily prayers and accurately manage their religious obligations.

## 2. Problem Statement & Objectives

### 2.1 Problem Statement
Many contemporary period tracking applications are designed purely from a medical or lifestyle perspective. They lack the specific logical parameters required to determine Islamic purity, such as tracking the exact duration of a valid period, identifying irregular bleeding (Istihadah), or calculating missed prayers that require replacement (Qada'). This leaves users to manually calculate their end period time, often leading to confusion regarding their validation for acts of worship.

### 2.2 Project Objectives
- Provide an interactive website for users to login, view, and manage their current and historical cycle data.
- Eliminate manual calculation errors by automating the determination of purity days, valid menstruation days.
- Support users in fulfilling their religious duties by implementing a structured system to track and notify Qada'(missed) prayers.

## 3. System Architecture

</p>

<p align="center">
    <b>Figure 1: Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of SuciTrack</b>
</p>

The database consists of two main entities: USERS and MENSTRUAL_RECORDS. 
A one-to-many relationship exists between the tables, where one user can create multiple menstrual records while each menstrual record belongs to only one user.

## 6. Sequence Diagram

<p align="center">
    <img src="public/images/SequenceDiagram.png" width="800">
</p>

<p align="center">
    <b>Figure 2: Sequence Diagram of SuciTrack</b>
</p>

The sequence diagram illustrates the interaction between the user, SuciTrack system, database, and JAKIM API. The process begins when a user registers an account and logs into the system. The application then verifies the user's credentials through the database before granting access to the dashboard. When a menstrual record is created, the system stores the record in the database and retrieves prayer time information from the JAKIM API based on the selected zone. The processed data is then displayed on the dashboard, allowing users to monitor their menstrual cycle information and prayer-related records through a centralized interface.

### Routes Configuration Explanation
The 'web.php' file in Laravel defines the web routes of the application. Routes determine how incoming HTTP requests are handled and which controller methods or views are returned. In this project, the routes are organized into two main categories: **public routes** and **authenticated routes**.

1. **Public Route**  
   - The root URL ('/') is mapped to the 'landing' view.  
   - This serves as the public homepage, accessible to all users without authentication.

2. **Authenticated Routes**  
   - These routes are grouped under middleware 'auth' and 'verified', ensuring only logged in and email-verified users can access them.  
   - Key routes include:
     - **Dashboard**: '/dashboard' calls 'DashboardController@index' and displays the main user dashboard.  
     - **Menstrual Records**:  
       - '/menstrual_records/end' calls 'MenstrualController@endCycle' to mark the end of a cycle.  
       - 'Route::resource('menstrual_records', MenstrualController::class)' automatically generates full CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) for menstrual records.  
     - **Qada Page**: '/qada' calls 'QadaController@index' to display the Qada (missed prayers) page.  
     - **Complete Qada**: '/dashboard/complete-qada/{id}' is a POST route that calls 'DashboardController@completeQada' to mark a specific Qada entry as completed.

3. **Authentication Routes**  
   - The file also includes 'auth.php', which contains all authentication-related routes such as login, registration, and password reset.

### MenstrualController Explanation

The MenstrualController manages all menstrual cycle records and integrates them with Qada (missed prayers) tracking. It provides CRUD operations, cycle management, and a dashboard view for users.

1. **Index**  
   - Retrieves all menstrual records for the authenticated user, ordered by start date.  
   - Displays them in the `menstrual_records.index` view.

2. **Create & Store**  
   - create() shows a form to start a new cycle.  
   - store() validates input, saves a new record with 'start_datetime', and sets 'end_datetime' as null until the cycle ends.

3. **Edit & Update**  
   - edit() loads a specific record for editing.  
   - update() validates the 'end_datetime', updates the record, deletes old Qada logs, and regenerates Qada entries using the **Qada Engine**.

4. **Destroy**  
   - Deletes a menstrual record and its associated Qada logs.

5. **Dashboard**  
   - Shows the user’s current cycle status ('activeRecord'), whether they are clean ('isClean'), number of purity days since last cycle, and counts of pending and completed Qada prayers.

6. **Qada Engine**  
   - 'generateQada()' calculates missed prayers during the menstrual period.  
   - It fetches prayer times via the **Aladhan API**, checks which prayers fall within the cycle, and auto-generates Qada logs for them.

7. **End Cycle**  
   - Redirects the user to edit the latest active cycle.  
   - If no active cycle exists, it shows an error message.

### DashboardController Explanation

The 'DashboardController' is responsible for displaying the main dashboard, summarizing menstrual cycle status, purity days, prayer times, and Qada (missed prayers) tracking.

1. **Index Method**  
   - Retrieves the latest menstrual records for the authenticated user.  
   - **Purity Logic**: Calculates `daysOfPurity` (days between cycles or since last ended cycle) and determines whether the user is currently clean (`isClean`).  
   - **Prayer Times**: Fetches today’s prayer times from the WaktuSolat API, with fallback static values if the API fails.  
   - **Qada Calculation**: Iterates through menstrual records to count missed prayers during cycles, then subtracts completed Qada logs to show pending totals.  
   - **Pending Qada**: Retrieves all incomplete Qada logs, ordered by date, and counts them.  
   - **Next Prayer**: Determines the upcoming prayer based on current time, ensuring correct fallback after midnight.  
   - Passes all computed data (`activeRecord`, `daysOfPurity`, `isClean`, `prayer`, `final`, `pendingQadaItems`, etc.) to the `dashboard` view.

2. **Complete Qada**  
   - Marks a specific Qada log as completed by updating its status.  
   - Redirects back to the dashboard with a success message.

3. **getTodayPrayerTimes**  
   - Calls the WaktuSolat API (`https://api.waktusolat.app/v2/solat/KUL`) to fetch prayer times for Kuala Lumpur.  
   - Extracts today’s timings (Subuh, Zohor, Asar, Maghrib, Isya) and returns them in a simplified format.  
   - Returns `null` if the API fails or data is missing.

<img width="1024" height="890" alt="Screenshot 2026-06-08 021755" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89990221-e45a-4c18-97a1-fe53365bb72f" />

### QadaController Explanation

1. **Index**  
   - Retrieves all Qada logs for the authenticated user, ordered by date.  
   - Calculates the number of pending (`is_completed = false`) and completed (`is_completed = true`) Qada prayers.  
   - Passes this data to the `indexqada` view for display.

2. **Create & Store**  
   - `create()` shows a form to add a new Qada log.  
   - `store()` validates input (`prayer_type`, `qada_date`), then creates a new log with default `is_completed = false`.  
   - Redirects to the index with a success message.

3. **Show**  
   - Displays details of a specific Qada log in the `showqada` view.

4. **Edit & Update**  
   - `edit()` loads a Qada log for editing.  
   - `update()` modifies the log’s attributes (`prayer_type`, `qada_date`, `is_completed`, `notes`).  
   - Redirects back with a success message.

5. **Destroy**  
   - Deletes a specific Qada log.  
   - Redirects to the index with confirmation.
  
### PrayerController 
<img width="1057" height="913" alt="Screenshot 2026-06-08 022338" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7c65820-c6e9-405a-94e6-dcbea0d6c6fd" />

### PrayerController Explanation

The `PrayerController` handles the retrieval and display of daily prayer times, as well as determining the next upcoming prayer for the user. It integrates with an external API to ensure accurate timings.

1. **Index Method**  
   - Calls the **Aladhan API** (`https://api.aladhan.com/v1/timingsByCity`) to fetch prayer times for Rawang, Malaysia.  
   - Extracts the five obligatory prayers: Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, and Isha.  
   - Converts these times into **Carbon objects** bound to the Malaysia timezone (`Asia/Kuala_Lumpur`) for real-time comparison.  
   - Determines the **next prayer** by checking which prayer time is still upcoming compared to the current time. Defaults to Fajr if all prayers for the day have passed.  
   - Provides localized labels (Subuh, Zohor, Asar, Maghrib, Isyak) for display.  
   - Passes the prayer times, next prayer, and labels to the `menstrual_records.dashboard` view.
  
### Model
### MenstrualRecord.php
<img width="660" height="602" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49e2bda1-dcf4-4e44-a174-40ca510cd900" />

### MenstrualRecord Model Explanation

The `MenstrualRecord` model represents menstrual cycle data in the application. It is an **Eloquent ORM model** that maps directly to the `menstrual_records` database table and defines the attributes and relationships used in the system.

1. **Fillable Attributes**  
     - `user_id` → links the record to a specific user.  
     - `start_datetime` → the date and time when the cycle begins.  
     - `end_datetime` → the date and time when the cycle ends.  
     - `duration_days` → stores the calculated length of the cycle in days.  
   - This protects against mass-assignment vulnerabilities by explicitly allowing only these fields.

2. **Relationship**  
   - Defines a `belongsTo` relationship with the `User` model.  
   - This means each menstrual record is associated with exactly one user, enabling queries like `$record->user` to retrieve the owner of the record.

3. **HasFactory Trait**  
   - The `HasFactory` trait allows the use of Laravel’s model factories for testing and seeding data.  
   - This makes it easier to generate sample menstrual records during development.
  
### QadaLog.php
<img width="688" height="914" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46bb99de-4bd6-4712-b94f-e90740ce447b" />

### QadaLog Model Explanation

The `QadaLog` model represents individual records of missed prayers (Qada) in the application. It is an **Eloquent ORM model** that maps to the `qada_logs` database table and defines the attributes, casting rules, and relationships needed for Qada tracking.

1. **Fillable Attributes**  
   The `$fillable` array allows mass assignment of:  
      -`user_id` → links the log to a specific user.  
      -`menstrual_record_id` → connects the log to a menstrual cycle record.  
      -`qada_date` → the date of the missed prayer.  
      -`prayer_type` → specifies which prayer (Subuh, Zohor, Asar, Maghrib, Isyak).  
      -`is_completed` → boolean flag indicating if the Qada has been performed.  
      -`notes` → optional remarks or context.

2. **Relationships**  
    -`user()` → defines a `belongsTo` relationship with the `User` model, linking each Qada log to its owner.  
    -`menstrualRecord()` → defines a `belongsTo` relationship with the `MenstrualRecord` model, connecting Qada logs to the cycle that generated them.

### Reminder.php
<img width="554" height="539" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9c4c948-77e7-46b4-b35b-6554aaf11a6c" />

### Reminder Model Explanation

The `Reminder` model represents  reminders in the application. It is an **Eloquent ORM model** that maps to the `reminders` table and defines the attributes and relationships needed for notification management.

This model provides a simple yet effective way to manage user notifications. By linking reminders to users, it ensures that important messages are delivered and monitored.

### User.php
<img width="632" height="870" alt="Screenshot 2026-06-08 024629" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7ee0907-e1cb-46d2-afa1-fa29be4e913c" />
<img width="715" height="906" alt="Screenshot 2026-06-08 024620" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c836b76c-c035-4df8-8cb6-ef44da4bfb5e" />

### User Model Explanation

The `User` model represents the people who use the application. It is built on Laravel’s authentication system, which handles login, registration, and security.  

- **Basic Information**  
  Stores the user’s `name`, `email`, and `password`. Sensitive fields like `password` and `remember_token` are hidden for security.  

- **Authentication Features**  
  Supports login and API tokens (via Sanctum), and allows notifications to be sent to users.  

- **Data Casting**  
  Automatically converts `email_verified_at` into a date and ensures `password` is securely hashed.  

- **Relationships**  
  - A user can have many **menstrual records** (`hasMany` relationship).  
  - A user can have many **reminders** (`hasMany` relationship).
